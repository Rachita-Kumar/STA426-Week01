## Information on the Zermatt Hiking Trail
> The five-lake trail is a magnificent hiking tour through the mountains of Zermatt: three of these mountain lakes reflect the Matterhorn. Offering unique views of the many peaks, the hiking route is extremely diverse.
### Description
The hiking trails around Zermatt snake around the mountains at impressive altitudes. But these heights are easily accessible: Cable cars and mountain railways take hikers up to Blauherd upper station, situated at 2,500 m above sea level. This upper station is the starting point for the hiking trail to Stellisee, Grindjisee, Grünsee, Moosjisee and Leisee.  

Each of the five lakes has its own unique shape, colour and character. Leisee is all about bathing and fun for the children. Grünsee is surrounded by a rather barren landscape, where stone pines somehow cling to boulders and sand. And the banks of Grindjisee are home to rare flowers.

The tour has no ascents or descents of note and offers phenomenal mountain panoramas as well as plenty of places to stop for a bite to eat.
